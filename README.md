# New Developments in Wavelet Modeling: Implications for International Finance

Common behaviors or patterns in jointly stationary time series can be identified and categorized using standard time domain techniques such as cross spectrum, cross correlation, and coherence. However, various economics and finance marketplaces, for example commodity markets, are complex with a wide variety of participants having different objectives. Time series formed by these nonstationary processes or characteristics consist of combinations of different components functioning at different frequencies. In order to understand these dynamic associations, we propose to explore not only the comovement of various time series but also the dynamic characteristics of each individual time series using time-varying spectral representations. We illustrate the value of these techniques in a short interactive workshop focused on wavelet modeling using **R**<a href="#note1" id="note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a>.

## This repository contains materials for my 2018 INFINITI Conference Workshop

The materials (.ipynb files) can be copy and pasted into R or RStudio (instructions below<a href="#note2" id="note2ref"><sup>2</sup></a>) or can be download as Jupyter notebooks (to be run with the "IR" kernel -- https://irkernel.github.io/).

### Footnotes:

<a id="note1" href="#note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a> We are currently collaborating with Dr. R. Benitez and Dr. V. Bolos in Valencia, Spain to create a comprehensive **R** package focused on the application of wavelets in finance and economics.
